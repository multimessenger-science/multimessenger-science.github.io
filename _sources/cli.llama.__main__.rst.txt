``llama`` Command Line Interface
================================

*This section covers utilities available at the command line through the*
``llama`` *command-line interface (CLI). All major commands are accessed
recursively through* ``llama`` *and correspond to packages in the* ``llama``
*library with the same names: for example,* ``llama run`` *is the command you
would use to start up the main LLAMA analysis daemon, and it corresponds to the
functionality defined in the* ``llama.run`` *module. Read through the
subcommands (including* ``llama run`` *as well as others exposing different
functionality) to learn how to use LLAMA to it's fullest from the command
line.*
